# Mushroom-Classification
*School Project*
### Mushroom classification using various ML algorithms after applying Label encoding and ONE-HOT Encoding.
- Experimenting with feature selection according to feature correlation.
- Applying PCA dimensionality reduction for analysis.
The goal of this project is to classify mushroom into edible or poisonous, while minimizing overfitting.
### Algorithms:
- SGD
- SVM
- Logistic Regression
- Decission Tree
- Random Forest
### Methods
- GridSearchCV
- PCA
- Feature Correlation
